**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

### Project Scope: 

This was a `Time-Crunch Sprint` challenge where I built out a `simple task tracking app` that allows you to enter tasks and track the progress. This was a `desktop build` that utilized `vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML`, and the `Bootstrap Framework`. 

- Meeting the tight deadline was a challenge, but I had the opportunity to practice more with `creating elements` within JavaScript and working with `local storage`. I think this challenge was my most successful attempt for this series.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project was part of a sprint challenge series that focused on functionality first, meeting the client's requirements, and supplying a working product prior to the time-crunched deadline. **There is opportunity to improve the UI & UX design and responsiveness, if desired.**
