**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

### Project Scope: 

This was a `single day sprint` challenge where I built out a `simple task tracking app` that allows you to enter tasks and track the progress. This was a `desktop build` that utilized `vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML`, and the `Bootstrap Framework`. Click [here](#desktop-preview) to see a preview of the task tracking app in action or check the status badge above to view the deployed website.

> [!NOTE]  
> The project focused on functionality first, meeting the client's requirements, and supplying a working product prior to the deadline. There is opportunity to improve the design and responsiveness, if desired.
